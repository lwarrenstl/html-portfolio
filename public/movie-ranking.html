<h2>My top 3 shows of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spongebob</h3>
<p>Not just for kids.  The first 4 seasons are sooooo funny.</p>
<h3>Home Movies</h3>
<p>By some of the creators of Bob's Burgers.  It was close but I think this is funnier.</p>
<h3>The Simpsons</h3>
<p>Of course! Again, you have to focus on the early seasons, first 10 years or so.</p>
